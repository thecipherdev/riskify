## 🧩 Fields Explained

### **Total Portfolio Amount**

> 💡 Your total trading capital — the full amount in your account available for trading.

### **Stop Loss %**

> 💡 The percentage distance from your entry price where your trade will
automatically close to limit losses.

### **Risk Level %**

> 💡 The portion of your account you’re willing to risk on this single trade
(e.g., 1% of $2,000 = $20 max loss).

### **Leverage x**

> ⚠️ Leverage amplifies both gains and losses.  
> Higher leverage can increase profits — but also increases the risk of liquidation.
Use wisely.
